# Spring Venture Group Prompt A/B Tester — Trustworthy Conversational Metrics

This repository contains a Streamlit MVP that compares two LLM prompts (Prompt A vs Prompt B) on the same call transcript
and computes lightweight evaluation metrics such as JSON compliance, coverage of expected keys, consistency, and
hallucination-risk heuristics.

**Status:** MVP skeleton — UI shell and project structure created. Functionality will be added in subsequent steps.
